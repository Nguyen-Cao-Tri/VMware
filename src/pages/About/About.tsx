      <h2>Intro:</h2>
      <p>
        Poodles come in three sizes or varieties: the standard (over 15 inches
        and 45 to 70 pounds [20 to 32 kilograms]), the miniature (10 or 11
        inches to 15 inches and 12 to 20 pounds [5 to 9 kilograms]) and the toy
        (less than 10 inches and about five to seven pounds [2 to 3 kilograms]).
        All the Poodles share a square outline, with a long, elegant neck and a
        straight back. The tail is docked, but not short, so it can wave gaily.
        Poodles tend to have a leggy appearance and a long muzzle combined with
        dropped ears. They move with a springy, lively gait. The coat of the
        poodle is its crowning glory. Dogs competing in the breed ring must have
        a specific clip, with areas of extravagant hair coupled with skin tight
        clipping. These clips actually developed for a reason: they provided
        thick coat over the joints and chest to keep the dog warm while working
        in cold water. Many guardians elect to keep their dogs in a kennel or
        working clip, with the coat clipped fairly short and pompoms left on the
        head and tail. A few poodles are seen with a corded coat, in which the
        tight curls form long bands like dreadlocks. The poodle coat should be
        tight and curly unless brushed out vigorously. Poodles are known as good
        dogs for people with allergies because the hair does not routinely shed
        out; instead, it mat to itself. This is why poodles need clipping or
        frequent grooming because the mats can be painful. The commonly seen
        colors of poodles are silver, black, white, apricot and chocolate. Reds
        do appear as well as creams and blues. Parti-colors such black and white
        are not considered acceptable in the show ring.

      <h2>Personality:</h2>
      <p>
        Poodles are notorious for their intelligence and ease of training. They
        are lively, active, fun-loving dogs with a sense of the ridiculous.
        Poodles thrive on attention and can develop bad habits such as nuisance
        barking if ignored or left alone. The smaller poodles can be aggressive
        to people outside their families or to other dogs. They should have
        early socialization to other people and pets and a firm hand in
        training. Poodles can be protective of their families and homes. It
        should be remembered that poodles are basically hunting dogs in elegant
        attire and do require exercise and training to be at their best as
        companion dogs.

      <h2>Living With:</h2>
      Poodles are easy keepers, and guardians should not indulge them with
      treats too much. They can easily become overweight. Many poodles live a
      comparatively long life, with the smaller poodles reaching as much as 17
      years of age, while the standards tend to live for 12 to 14 years.
      Grooming is a fact of life with a poodle. With the tendency of the coat to
      mat, poodles should have a close clip or be groomed almost daily. Show
      coats require frequent baths, the tying up of topknots and ear fringes and
      oiling of the coat to keep it from getting brittle. A steady hand on the
      scissors is also important. Poodles are good family dogs â€” fun, energetic,
      smart and easy to train. They do best with plenty of exercise for both
      mind and body and prefer to be with people most of the time. They are not
      good kennel dogs. Socialization should begin early and include other
      people, other pets and the grooming routine. These dogs are exceptional
      jumpers, so be careful with your yard fencing!
